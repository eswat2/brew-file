# brew-file

My personal setup for brew built around `brew bundle`...

## requirements

- nit == `gem install nit`

## installation

The contents of this repo are designed to be installed in a `~/.brew-file` folder.  This is the location used by the included `bru` script.

Running the `bru` script will check your brew configuration and update the packages defined in the `Brewfile`.  I use this to easily keep my development tools updated.

YMMV...
